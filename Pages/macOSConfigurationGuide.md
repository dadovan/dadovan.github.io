# Overview

This page will be updated from time to time with various tools and config changes I use to make macOS work better for me.

## Software

### General

[Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/)
Great for arranging windows on macOS.

[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
I use this to map my keyboard number pad to be the arrow keys.

[HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch)
I can’t get used to macOS’s way of alt-tabbing between windows.

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
Oh, the great and powerful terminal.

[Microsoft Edge canary](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download)
I know, this one sounds out there but I found it more stable than Chrome and it is just as fast. Microsoft finally dumped their own rendering engine and adopted the one from Chrome. This means I still get to use all my Chrome extensions that weren’t in the Edge extension library like Pro for Trello and Next Step for Trello.

[Microsoft OneNote](http://www.onenote.com/download)
I store tons of data here.

[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download)

### Development

[Azure Data Studio](https://aka.ms/azuredatastudio)
I’m still deciding between JetBrains DataGrip and Azure Data Studio.

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
My go-to code space for everything but Java.

[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
I have their “all-tools” subscription. I’m a heavy Resharper and IntelliJ user and sometimes use PyCharm and DataGrip. I haven’t really used Rider.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Other configuration

Force Finder to always show all files

`$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES (undo = FALSE)`
